# Strategic MVP Codex Run Prompts

## Recommended mode

Current READY / approved Unity implementation packet: **None**. `STORY-STRAT-OBJECTIVE-001` is DONE / merged. Do not run Codex until a new story is explicitly promoted to READY / approved.

`STORY-INTEL-001`, `STORY-INTEL-002`, `STORY-INTEL-003`, `STORY-INTEL-004`, `STORY-UX-001`, `STORY-QA-005`, `STORY-CMD-001`, `STORY-CMD-002`, `STORY-CMD-003`, `STORY-CMD-004`, `STORY-QA-006`, `STORY-QA-007`, `STORY-CMD-005`, and `STORY-STRAT-OBJECTIVE-001` are DONE / merged. The EPIC-005 repair train is exhausted and awaiting human closeout/direction.

## Copy-safe prompt-file mode

If PowerShell shows `>>`, the here-string was not closed correctly. Avoid here-strings entirely and run Codex from checked-in prompt files instead.

Current approved prompt file: **None**. Historical prompt files remain for audit only.

## Windows PowerShell preflight

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-game-design
git pull --ff-only origin main

cd C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-unity
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git status --short
```

If `git status --short` prints anything, stop and inspect before running Codex.

## Current approved prompt

No runnable prompt is currently approved. If Codex is launched from any historical prompt, it must stop unless the design/control repo has promoted a new story to `status: ready` and `approval: approved`.

## Historical prompt-file runs

Historical prompt-file runs are retained in this folder for audit only:

Current prompt-file run:

- None.

## After Codex finishes

Codex should not run until a new READY / approved story exists. Next human action: review EPIC-005 closeout or choose the next epic/story direction.
