# Strategic MVP Codex Run Prompts

## Recommended mode

`STORY-QA-005 PlayMode Evidence Artifact Hygiene` is DONE / merged. `EPIC-VSLICE-MVP-005 Champion Command and Operations On-Ramp` and `STORY-CMD-001` are drafted as the next candidate direction, but there is no current READY Unity implementation packet.

`STORY-INTEL-001`, `STORY-INTEL-002`, `STORY-INTEL-003`, `STORY-INTEL-004`, `STORY-UX-001`, and `STORY-QA-005` are DONE / merged. `STORY-CMD-001` is READY-candidate / approval pending; no Unity implementation is authorized until it is explicitly approved.

## Copy-safe prompt-file mode

If PowerShell shows `>>`, the here-string was not closed correctly. Avoid here-strings entirely and run Codex from checked-in prompt files instead.

No current approved prompt-file command exists. STORY-QA-005 is DONE / merged, and its prompt file is retained for historical audit only.

## Windows PowerShell preflight

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-game-design
git pull --ff-only origin main

cd C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-unity
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git status --short
```

If `git status --short` prints anything, stop and inspect before running Codex.

## Current approved prompt

None. STORY-CMD-001 is only READY-candidate / approval pending. Do not run a Unity implementation agent until it or another story is explicitly READY / approved.

## Historical prompt-file runs

Historical prompt-file runs are retained in this folder for audit only:

- `production/sprints/codex-story-intel-003.prompt.txt`
- `production/sprints/codex-story-intel-004.prompt.txt`

Current approved prompt:

- None. `production/sprints/codex-story-qa-005.prompt.txt` is retained for historical audit only. `production/sprints/codex-story-cmd-001.prompt.txt` is a guarded non-runnable candidate prompt.

## After Codex finishes

No current post-Codex action. STORY-CMD-001 must not be run until the human resolves its source-authority/open-value questions and explicitly promotes it to READY.
