# Strategic MVP Codex Run Prompts

## Recommended mode

`STORY-TAC-005` is merged. There is no new READY implementation packet yet. The next drafted candidate is `STORY-MAP-001 Larger Two-Base Strategic Map Slice`; review and resolve its ambiguity check before running Codex.

Do not run an implementation agent from this document until a story is explicitly marked READY/approved.

## Copy-safe prompt-file mode

If PowerShell shows `>>`, the here-string was not closed correctly. Avoid here-strings entirely and run Codex from checked-in prompt files instead.

Preferred next-step review:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-game-design
git pull --ff-only origin main
code .\production\stories\story-map-001-larger-two-base-strategic-map-slice.md
```

Only after human approval promotes `STORY-MAP-001` to READY should a checked-in Codex prompt be created and run.

## Windows PowerShell preflight

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-game-design
git pull --ff-only origin main

cd C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-unity
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git status --short
```

If `git status --short` prints anything, stop and inspect before running Codex.

## Current Prompt A — no approved implementation packet

`STORY-MAP-001` is drafted but not READY. Do not run Codex yet.

Review this file first:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-game-design
code .\production\stories\story-map-001-larger-two-base-strategic-map-slice.md
```

## Historical prompt-file runs

Historical prompt-file runs are retained in this folder for audit only:

- `production/sprints/codex-story-strat-002.prompt.txt`
- `production/sprints/codex-story-strat-003.prompt.txt`

- `production/sprints/codex-story-loop-002.prompt.txt`
- `production/sprints/codex-story-tac-005.prompt.txt`

Current approved prompt:

- None. `STORY-MAP-001` is a draft candidate and has no implementation prompt yet.

## After Codex finishes

N/A until a next story is promoted to READY and this document is updated with a checked-in prompt.
