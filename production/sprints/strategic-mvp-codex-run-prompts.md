# Strategic MVP Codex Run Prompts

## Recommended mode

No Unity implementation story is currently READY after `STORY-QA-003` and hotfix PR #26. Human closeout review rejected the current usability/readability state: map still tiny/unreadable, labels overlap, text obstructs buttons, no zoom/focus, clicked object is unclear, and button meaning is unclear.

`STORY-QA-004 Playability Map Scale, Zoom, and UI Clarity Pass` is drafted as READY-candidate / approval pending. Do not create a Unity branch or run Codex for QA-004 until the user explicitly approves implementation.

## Copy-safe prompt-file mode

If PowerShell shows `>>`, the here-string was not closed correctly. Avoid here-strings entirely and run Codex from checked-in prompt files instead.

Current guarded planning prompt-file command:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-game-design
git pull --ff-only origin main

$prompt = Get-Content -Raw "C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-game-design\production\sprints\codex-next-step-epic-closeout.prompt.txt"
codex exec --sandbox workspace-write $prompt
```

## Windows PowerShell preflight

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-game-design
git pull --ff-only origin main

cd C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-unity
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git status --short
```

If `git status --short` prints anything, stop and inspect before running Codex.

## Current Prompt A — next-step epic closeout decision brief

Use the checked-in guarded planning prompt file:

```powershell
$prompt = Get-Content -Raw "C:\Users\NordicGamer\CodexProjects\neon-champions-game-design\production\sprints\codex-next-step-epic-closeout.prompt.txt"
codex exec --sandbox workspace-write $prompt
```

This is not an implementation prompt. It exists to prepare the human decision for the next epic/story direction after QA-003.

Current next candidate, not approved for implementation:

- `production/stories/story-qa-004-playability-map-scale-zoom-and-ui-clarity-pass.md`

## After Codex finishes

Codex should return a decision brief only. Do not create a Unity branch, do not open a PR, and do not mark a new story READY unless the human explicitly approves an implementation direction.
